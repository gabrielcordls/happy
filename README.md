# Project "Happy", Third edition of Next Level Week. ðŸ˜ƒ

The Happy project, developed during the Next Level Week, from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), from the 12th to the 18th of October.
The project is inspired by Charities, which carry out very important work in the world. And it is intended to encourage children to visit orphanages, which is a beautiful thing to see the happiness of children.
And the challenge for the week was to propose not only programming, but also a little reflection. 
Let's bring happiness to the world!
